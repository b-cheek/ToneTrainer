# ToneTrainer
An ear training app for iOS and Android designed to help musicians improve their abilities in identifying and analyzing tuning problems in music.

## Setup
Install the dependencies with `yarn`. Then the development server can be run with `npx expo start`. The server can target Expo Go or a native Expo development client app [built and installed](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/#get-started) on an iOS or Android device. ToneTrainer has only been tested on Android using Expo Go and native Expo development clients, and production builds have not been created yet.
